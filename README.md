## My process

To begin with, we set the HTML structure. Then, we worked on css styling. We styled mobile first and once mobile version was all set, we added some minor styling for desktop version.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I remembered a couple of handy css properties:

```css
body {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  min-height: 100vh;
}

.container {
  box-shadow: 0px 0px 26px -2px hsl(218, 44%, 60%);
}
```

### Continued development

I need to keep working on flex properties and box-shadow.

### Useful resources

- [Box Shadow Generator](https://www.cssmatic.com/box-shadow) - This helped us to generate the accurate box shadow.
